As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

this app is to track and create workout tracking. I deployed to Heroku and on the MongoDB database.

this app was pretty difficult to do but it is now working and running.
